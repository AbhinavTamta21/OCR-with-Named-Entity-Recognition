# OCR-with-Named-Entity-Recognition
This project combines Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract text from images or webcam captures and identify entities such as persons, organizations, locations, and miscellaneous items. The extracted entities are saved as CSV and Excel files, and the text can also be sent to Unity for further processing.
